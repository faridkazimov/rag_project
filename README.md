#  Document Question-Answering System (RAG Project)

This project is an interactive web application that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to answer natural language questions about the content of a single text document.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.
- **RAG Architecture:** Prevents OpenAI LLMs from "hallucinating" by producing reliable answers based only on the provided document.
- **Local Embeddings:** Uses Hugging Face's free `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to convert texts into vectors, significantly reducing costs.
- **Fast Search:** Employs Facebook AI's FAISS library as the vector database for efficient searching.
- **Cost Control:** Includes a limit of 3 questions per user session.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **LangChain:** The main framework for managing the RAG flow.
- **Streamlit:** Used for creating the web interface.
- **OpenAI:** Used for the Generation step (answering the question).
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Used for text embeddings.
- **FAISS:** Used for the vector database.
