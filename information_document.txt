Project Titan - 2025 Progress Report

Overview:
Project Titan is an R&D initiative aimed at developing autonomous delivery drones. The year 2025 has been a year in which the project's initial field tests were successfully completed and significant technological milestones were reached.

Technical Developments:
The flight range of the drones has been increased by 40% to 70 kilometers thanks to new generation battery technology. Our route optimization algorithm, named "PathFinder V3," has improved delivery times by an average of 15%. The maximum carrying capacity measured during the tests was 5 kilograms.

Field Tests and Results:
A total of 200 hours of autonomous flight was successfully completed in field tests conducted in the rural areas of Nev≈üehir. The biggest challenge encountered during the tests was severe wind conditions. To address this challenge, a new software update is planned to improve the drones' stability system.

Budget and Human Resources:
The project's 2025 R&D budget was utilized at $2 million. The project team consists of a total of 15 people, including 12 engineers and 3 operations specialists.

Future Plans:
Our 2026 goal is to add night vision capabilities to the drones.
